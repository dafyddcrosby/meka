There is an old project for Microsoft Visual Studio 6,
but it not up to date. If you need to use it you'll probably have 
to add missing .C files to the tree, and setup some library (libpng, etc).

Alternatively, I heard that some tools exists to convert a MSVC 7.x 
project back to a project for MSVC 6.x
